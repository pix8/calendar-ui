# pix8/ui-calendar


## Work in progress

Rudimentary calendar interface leveraging @pix8/calendar module. Currently exists as a development mule to proof and validate the approach.

The ultimate aim is to produce a highly modular calendar UI that is indifferent to it's treatment to showcase that applied UI engineering in the light of discernable UI design patterns is the way forward and the smarter choice.

Interface is expedited in react.js and vue.js.
